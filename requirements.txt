# The OpenAI Python SDK currently depends on httpx<0.28.0, because
# newer versions removed the deprecated `proxies` argument used by
# OpenAI. Without pinning httpx to 0.27.2 the app crashes with
# ``TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'``.
httpx==0.27.2

# Additional dependencies
#
# streamlit-authenticator provides an easy way to add user
# authentication to Streamlit apps. It is used in `app.py` to
# manage login/logout and cookie storage. sqlite3 is part of the
# Python standard library and does not need to be installed via
# pip, but we mention it here for clarity.
